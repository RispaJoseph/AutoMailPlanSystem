# backend/mailplans/signals.py
"""
Guarded signal handlers for MailPlan.

Previous behavior: this signal enqueued a send_mail_task on every MailPlan post_save,
causing newly-created plans to be sent immediately (regardless of trigger type or delays).

New behavior:
 - By default this file does NOTHING on MailPlan save.
 - To enable the old automatic behavior (only in controlled environments), set:
       ALLOW_AUTO_ENQUEUE=1
   in the environment. Even then, the code will only auto-enqueue for a
   conservative set of trigger types and only when the MailPlan is newly created.

If you want automatic sends on real user signup or other real events, wire
those events explicitly to a handler instead of using a generic model post_save.
